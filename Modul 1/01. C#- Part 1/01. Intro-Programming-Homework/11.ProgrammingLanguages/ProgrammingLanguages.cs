        /* 1.Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in the 1990s.
one of the most in-demand programming languages, a standard for enterprise software, web-based content, games and mobile apps, as well as the Android operating system.
It is designed to work across multiple software platforms.
Java and C# are similar programming languages that are statically, strongly, and manifestly typed, both are class-based object-oriented,
both are designed with semi-interpretation or runtime compilation in mind, both use garbage-collection, and both are "curly brace languages" like C and C++.
he main difference is that Java can be run on any operating system, while C# typically requires Windows and the .NET framework.
There are also mostly minor differences in keywords and syntax and in the use of some classes, exception handling etc.




2.C++ is an intermediate-level language with object-oriented programming features, originally designed to enhance the C language.
It's used to develop systems software, application software, high-performance server and client applications and video games.
It also powers major software like Firefox ,Winamp and Adobe.
C# provides a managed memory model that adds a higher level of abstraction
that adds convenience and improves development times, but complicates access to lower level APIs and makes specialized 
performance requirements problematic.
The syntax of C# is much simpler and prone than C/C++ and is easier for learning.



3.PHP (Hypertext Processor) is a free, server-side scripting language designed for dynamic websites and app development.
It can be directly embedded into an HTML source document rather than an external file, which has made it a popular programming language for web developers.
It powers more than 200 million websites.
The differences between PHP and C# is that PHP is a dynamic and interpreted while C# is static and needs to be compiled.



4.JavaScript is a client and server-side scripting language developed by Netscape that derives much of its syntax from C.
It can be used across multiple web browsers and is considered essential for developing interactive or animated web functions.
JavaScript interpreters are embedded in Google's Chrome extensions, Apple's Safari extensions, Adobe Acrobat and Reader, and Adobe's Creative Suite.
It is also used in game development and writing desktop applications. 
The differences between JS and C# are that JS can be run on any platform, directly in any browser and is interpreted as opposed
to compiled, and that JS is not object-oriented and class-based. Also there is no need to specify variable types like int, long, string etc.





5.Python is a high-level, server-side scripting language for websites and mobile apps.
It's considered a fairly easy language for beginners due to its readability and compact syntax,
meaning developers can use fewer lines of code to express a concept than they would in other languages.
It is used by Google, Yahoo! and NASA.
Python projects are often open-source, web-based, and/or cross-platform and it has a larger user base on mac and unix-based platforms.
C# projects are often proprietary, windows-based applications. There's very few non-windows C# projects.
