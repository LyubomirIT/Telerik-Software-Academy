        /* .NET is an application development framework - it contains numerous libraries containing a range of functionality.
It includes a large class library known as Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language 
interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. 

Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (as contrasted to hardware environment), 
known as Common Language Runtime (CLR), an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, 
memory management, and exception handling. FCL and CLR together constitute .NET Framework.


C# is a strong Object Oriented programming language that is mostly built on the .NET framework.
It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and is one of the programming languages 
designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.
