        /* 1.Visual studio  is used to develop computer programs for Microsoft Windows, as well as web sites, web applications and web services.
It uses Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both native code and managed code.
Visual Studio supports different programming languages such as c++;vC++;VB.Net;VC#;F#. It also supports XML/XSLT, HTML/XHTML, JavaScript and CSS.




2.Eclipse contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. Written mostly in Java, It can be used to develop applications.
Eclipse can also used to develop applications in other languages such as  Ada, ABAP, C, C++, COBOL, Fortran, Haskell, JavaScript, Lasso, Natural, Perl, PHP, 
Prolog, Python, R, Ruby (including Ruby on Rails framework), Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Scheme, and Erlang.



3.Code::blocks supports multiple compilers including GCC, Clang and Visual C++.
It is developed in C++ using wxWidgets as the GUI toolkit. Using a plugin architecture, its capabilities and features are defined by the provided plugins.
It is oriented towars c++ and Fortran.
Code::Blocks is being developed for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X and has been ported to FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Solaris.




4.Dev-C++ is a free integrated development environment (IDE) distributed under the GNU General Public License for programming in C and C++.
The IDE is written in Delphi.The project is hosted by SourceForge. Dev-C++ runs exclusively on Microsoft Windows.
Dev-C++ is generally considered a Windows-only program, but there are attempts to create a Linux version: header files and path delimiters are switchable between platforms.
Users of Dev-C++ can download additional libraries, or packages of code that increase the scope and functionality of Dev-C++, such as graphics, compression, animation, sound support and many more.




5.Netbeans is used primarly with Java but also with other languages, in particular PHP, C/C++, and HTML5.
The NetBeans IDE is written in Java and can run on Windows, OS X, Linux, Solaris and other platforms supporting a compatible JVM(Java virtual Machine).
The Platform allows applications to be developed from a set of modular software components called modules.
The NetBeans Team actively support the product and seek feature suggestions from the wider community. Every release is preceded by a time for Community testing and feedback.




6.Xcode contains a suite of software development tools developed by Apple for developing software for OS X and iOS.
The latest stable release is version 6.1 and is available via the Mac App Store free of charge for Mac OS X Lion, OS X Mountain Lion, OS X Mavericks and OS X Yosemite users.




7.CodeLite is a cross platform IDE for the C/C++ programming languages using the wxWidgets toolkit.
CodeLite features project management (workspace / projects), code completion, code refactoring, source browsing, syntax highlight.
It is distributed under the GNU General Public License v2 or Later.
It is being developed and debugged using itself as the development platform with daily updates available through its Git repository.




8.Anjuta is an integrated development environment written for the GNOME project.
It supports for the C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python and Vala programming languages.
It comes standard on base installation DVDs of major Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, openSUSE, Fedora, and Mandriva Linux.
The goal of Anjuta DevStudio is to provide a customizable and extensible IDE framework and at the same time provide implementations of common development tools.
